# AppTelemetry Development

Hi, 

this repository contains no code, but Tickets and Discussions for the development of AppTelemetry. You are very much invited to participate! Create new **tickets** for features you'd like or bugs you found, or discuss existing tickets. You can also use the **Discussions** tab to ask about how to use AppTelemetry, how to create specific insights, advice on how to get the most out of the app, or any other questions or comments you feel like talking about.

see you around
-- Daniel

PS: If you prefer real-time conversation, AppTelemetry also has a [Slack](https://apptelemetry.io/pages/slack.html)!
