# TelemetryDeck Development

Hi, 

this repository contains no code, but Tickets and Discussions for the development of TelemetryDeck Viewer for iOS and macOS. You are very much invited to participate! Create new **tickets** for features you'd like or bugs you found, or discuss existing tickets. You can also use the **Discussions** tab to ask about how to use TelemetryDeck, how to create specific insights, advice on how to get the most out of the app, or any other questions or comments you feel like talking about.

Other places of interest:

- The TelemetryDeck [Swift Client](https://github.com/TelemetryDeck/SwiftClient) for inclusion into your app
- Check out the [Boards](https://github.com/orgs/TelemetryDeck/projects) for the current pipeline of features
- If you prefer real-time conversation, TelemetryDeck also has a [Slack](https://telemetrydeck.com/pages/slack.html)!

see you around
